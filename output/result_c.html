<li>To nominate, for the Dean’s consideration, the speaker for the Anderson Distinguished Lecture Series, and other high-profile speakers coming to the Farmer School. Recommendations for the Anderson Series should be based on the MOA with the Anderson family, keeping in mind potential budget constraints. </li>
<li>In making speaker recommendations, the Committee should consider scholarly or professional achievement, outstanding service to society, unique contribution to businesses or economies, social, technological or entrepreneurial innovation, and such other characteristics as the Committee shall consider worthy. </li>
<li>All recommendations should consider that high profile speakers are often linked with controversial subjects, and while the purpose of these speakers is not to agitate members of the campus community, open dialogue on meaningful issues is at the heart of the university mission.</li>
<li>The Committee will meet to address its annual charge. Meeting minutes will be taken.</li>
